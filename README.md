Welcome to my Codewars Repository! This Repository showcases my solutions to various coding challenges on Codewars, covering a range of programming languages that I use and difficulty levels. It's a testament to my continuous learning and problem solving abilities.

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E"/>

I complete at least one Codewars Challenge everyday!

## Motivation
Completing these challenges has helped me improve on my problem solving skills as my passion for coding drives me to tackle increasingly complex problems and continuously improve.

## Optimizations
After submitting a solution for my Codewars, I almost always try to refactor and optimize my code. Sometimes to make it faster, somtimes to make my code more readable.

## Lessons Learned:
One of the biggest lessons Iv'e learned while tackling these challenges is that It's okay to not always know how to solve a problem. As long as you take the time to improve and learn from what you don't know. As a developer, continuous learning is always involved. You never stop learning!
