// It's bonus time in the big city! The fatcats are rubbing their paws in anticipation... but who is going to make the most money?

// Build a function that takes in two arguments (salary, bonus). Salary will be an integer, and bonus a boolean.

// If bonus is true, the salary should be multiplied by 10. If bonus is false, the fatcat did not make enough money and must receive only his stated salary.

// Return the total figure the individual will receive as a string prefixed with "£" (= "\u00A3", JS, Go, Java, Scala, and Julia), "$" (C#, C++, Dart, Ruby, Clojure, Elixir, PHP, Python, Haskell, and Lua) or "¥" (Rust).

// My solution
function bonusTime(salary, bonus) {
  return bonus ? `£${salary * 10}` : `£${salary}`;
}
